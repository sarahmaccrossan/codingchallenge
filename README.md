ScreenCloud Coding Challenge

I misread initially and built the front end for an actual webapp for a banking for a computer or mobile device, so I have included a homepage and login page before the pin entry page.

1. Bank app begins at the index file and can also be accessed here - http://smaccrossan01.lampt.eeecs.qub.ac.uk/screencloud/enterpin.php
2. Click on the login button
3. Username and password are currently just there for show, so enter anything and click next.
4. Submit blank or incorrect pin first to see api error message.
5. Submit pin 1111 to see successful api message
6. Enter 163 into amount you would like to withdraw
7. Enter 340 into amount you would like to withdraw
8. Enter 240 into amount you would like to withdraw
9. Enter specified amounts from challenge to withdraw
10. The counting out of notes or updating the balance was not fully achieved but please see working in maths.java file
